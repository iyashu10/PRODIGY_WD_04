Personal Portfolio
This is a simple, yet professional portfolio website designed to showcase my skills, projects, and experience as a web developer. The website is structured to provide a seamless browsing experience, with a clean and modern design. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it highlights key aspects of my development journey, including an “About Me” section, a gallery of projects, and a contact form for easy communication.
